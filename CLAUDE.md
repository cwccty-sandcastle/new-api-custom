# CLAUDE.md — Project Conventions for new-api

## MANDATORY: Read AGENTS.md with the Read tool

Do not treat `@AGENTS.md` as loaded. Claude Code does not reliably inline that import.

Before any planning, coding, reviewing, or answering a project question, you MUST call the Read tool on the repo-root file `AGENTS.md` and wait for the full contents. This is the first action of every session and every new task.

Rules:

- Do not start from memory, summaries, or this file alone.
- Do not skip the Read because a previous turn mentioned AGENTS.md.
- Do not replace the Read with a grep, glob, or partial skim.
- After reading, follow every rule in `AGENTS.md` for the rest of the work.
- If the task touches `web/`, also Read `web/AGENTS.md` before editing frontend files.
- If the task touches billing as defined under **Billing rules (mandatory read gate)** in `AGENTS.md`, also Read `.agents/rules/billing.md` in full before planning or editing. Tasks outside that definition may skip it.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues on the fork `cwccty-sandcastle/new-api-custom`, not on upstream. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Triage uses the five canonical labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root and one `docs/adr/`, both created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### `docs/agents/` exception

`AGENTS.md` forbids adding new files under `docs/`. The three files referenced above — `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` — are the explicitly authorized exception, because the agent skills hardcode those paths. Nothing else may be added to `docs/agents/` under this exception.
